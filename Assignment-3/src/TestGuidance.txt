Testing Guidance:
Unit Testing: Test individual components (e.g., TodoForm, TodoItem) for rendering, state changes, and event handling.

Integration Testing: Test how components interact together (e.g., adding a task and verifying it appears in the list).

Edge Cases: Test scenarios such as adding empty tasks, marking tasks as complete, deleting tasks, and ensuring localStorage behaves as expected across different browsers.

use tools like jest and react testing library for unit testing and integration testing.
